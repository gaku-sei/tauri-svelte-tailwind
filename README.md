# Tauri, Svelte, and Tailwind template

- Native application wrapper and logic in [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/)
- UI in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- Style with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Get started

You can use the `Use this template` button in GitHub and then replace all the occurences of `tauri-svelte-tailwind` (in `package.json`, Tauri config file, and Cargo file) by your app name.
